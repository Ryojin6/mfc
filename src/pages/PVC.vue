          description="   In our eyes, the real power of a successful project lies in
          fruitful and direct cooperation between the team and the
          community. A great project cannot exist without a great
          community, the synergy between these two is what gets the
          ball rolling, that’s the point where new ideas come to life,
          where the concepts are transformed into fully working
          mechanisms, that’s where the great things take place."

          description="  Delivering value is a point of our interest from the very
          beginning, not the mint, the actual start. January 2022 is
          the month when the Resurā brand was born, from that point,
          we’ve been building and planning products and services day
          and night, so we can deliver our products without making the
          holders wait long months. We stand by the way that a project
          aiming for greatness needs to start building way earlier
          than when mint happens. The mint is a connection between the
          Resurā community and the team, we’ve been on this road for
          the past 7 months. Now, we need your piece of the puzzle to
          this fine jigsaw."

          description=" When everyone looks to the right, we look to the left. A
          change is needed, and it is inevitable. Resurā is here to
          change the narrative of a typical anime project. Even tho,
          there are many anime/Japanese art culture lovers among us,
          Solana space lacks anime-themed projects with actual
          builders trying to build new stuff and bring new products.
          That caused many people to automatically condemn such
          projects. We're here to change this. Give us a chance, or
          don't, we will prove this anyway."
